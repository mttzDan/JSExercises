//Exercise 5

let people = ["Maria", "Dani", "Luis", "Juan", "Camila"];


//Write a command that prints out all of the people in the list.

console.log (people.join(", "))

//Write the command to remove "Dani" from the array.

people.splice(1, 1)
console.log (people.join(", "))

//Write the command to remove "Juan" from the array.

people.splice(2, 1)
console.log (people.join(", "))

//Write the command to move "Luis" to the front of the array.

people.unshift(people.splice(1,1))
console.log (people.join(", "))

//Write the command to add your name to the end of the array.

people.push ("Daniel")
console.log (people.join(", "))


//Using a loop, iterate through this array and after console.log "Maria", exit from the loop.

for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i]);
    if (people[i]=="Maria")
    break;
}

//Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Maria" is located.

console.log(`Maria is in index: ${people.indexOf("Maria")}`)

//At the end of the exercise, there should be 4 people in the array.

console.log (people.join(", "))
